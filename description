Here’s a marketing-ready feature roadmap for your Next.js Energy Management System dashboard—designed to showcase sustainability, clean-energy investment, and real-time control across North America:

🌎 Network-Wide View
Interactive North America Map

Pins for every EMS site (battery farms, solar arrays, EV hubs)

Clustered “heatmap” overlay showing renewable penetration and CO₂ savings by region

Global KPI Strip

Total installed capacity (MWh)

Aggregate carbon offset (tons CO₂ avoided)

Total revenue from grid services (USD)

% of on-site renewables vs. grid draw

Region & Group Filters

Drill into regions (West Coast, Midwest, Northeast, etc.)

Tag-based grouping (e.g. “Commercial Sites,” “Fleet Chargers,” “Solar+Battery”).

🔍 Zoomed-In & Clustered Views
Cluster Dashboard Cards

Summary cards for each group: total SOC, active DR events, EV sessions in last hour

Sparkline mini-charts for power flow, revenue, and CO₂ savings trends

Quick-Switch Tabs

“All Sites” → “Region A” → “Group B” → “Individual System”

Breadcrumb trail + smooth animated transitions

🏭 Individual System Detail
3D Energy Flow Diagram

Real-time arrows showing kW flow between:

Solar panels → Site load

Site load ↔ Battery

Battery ↔ Grid (injection or draw)

EV chargers ↔ Battery/Grid

Clickable components to drill into inverter stats, battery modules, or charger racks

Live Metrics Panel

SOC%, voltage, current, temperature per battery string

PV generation vs. inverter efficiency
