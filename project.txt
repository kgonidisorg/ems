Key Features
Backend (Spring Boot + Spring Data + Java)

REST + GraphQL APIs for device management, user accounts, analytics.

Real-time data ingestion using Kafka, MQTT, or WebSockets (simulated IoT device streams).

Spring Data JPA for persistence, plus Redis for caching hot data.

Security: JWT authentication with roles (user/admin).

Analytics service: aggregate usage by time, detect anomalies (e.g., spike detection), and provide endpoints for reports.

Frontend (React)

Authentication flow (login, register, roles).

Dashboard showing:

Real-time charts (energy usage updating live with WebSockets).

Historical trends with filters (day/week/month).

Device control panel (start/stop devices, simulated actions).

Visualization with charting libs (Recharts, D3, Chart.js).

UI polish: modern design system (Material UI or Tailwind), dark mode, responsive.

DevOps

Dockerized services (Spring Boot backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL, Kafka/MQTT).

CI/CD with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.

Deploy to Kubernetes on AWS/GCP/Azure (Helm charts).

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) for bonus points.

Real-time Data Flow

Backend receives streaming device telemetry via Kafka/MQTT.

React frontend subscribes to updates via WebSocket.

Users see charts update live without refreshing.

Graphics / UX polish

Clean, interactive dashboard experience (inspired by Datadog, Grafana, Tesla apps).

Custom branding, icons, and animations for polish.
