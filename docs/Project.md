- **TestContainers Config**: May need updates for PostgreSQL port changes

#### 🎯 Backend Status Verification

- **Device Service**: ✅ Returns paginated empty results (working as expected)
- **PostgreSQL**: ✅ All database connections established and working
- **Core Services**: ✅ Individual services accessible on their respective ports
- **Docker Compose**: ✅ All services start successfully with proper networking

## 🔧 Backend Issues and Resolution Steps

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

#### 1. Redis Health Check Failures
**Status**: ⚠️ Non-blocking issue - services work but health checks fail
**Impact**: Health monitoring and caching may be affected
**Root Cause**: Redis connection configuration or timing issues

**Resolution Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Check Redis container logs
docker logs ems-redis

# 2. Test Redis connectivity from auth service
docker exec -it ems-auth-service sh
nc -z redis 6379

# 3. Verify Redis configuration in application.yml
# Check lettuce pool settings and timeout configurations

# 4. Test Redis operations manually
docker exec -it ems-redis redis-cli ping
```

**Expected Fix**:
- Update Redis configuration in auth-service application.yml
- Adjust connection pool settings and timeouts
- Verify Redis health check endpoint configuration

#### 2. API Gateway Routing Issues
**Status**: ⚠️ Individual services work, but gateway routing needs debugging
**Impact**: Frontend may need to call services directly instead of through gateway
**Root Cause**: Service discovery or routing configuration problems

**Resolution Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Test API Gateway health
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

# 2. Check gateway routing configuration
# Verify routes in application.yml for each service

# 3. Test direct service routing through gateway
curl http://localhost:8080/auth/actuator/health
curl http://localhost:8080/devices/api/v1/devices

# 4. Check gateway logs for routing errors
docker logs ems-api-gateway
```

**Expected Fix**:
- Update Spring Cloud Gateway routing configuration
- Verify service discovery settings
- Ensure proper service name resolution in Docker network

#### 3. TestContainers PostgreSQL Configuration
**Status**: ⚠️ Tests may fail due to port change from 5432 to 5433
**Impact**: Integration tests might not run correctly
**Root Cause**: TestContainers still configured for default PostgreSQL port

**Resolution Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Update test configuration files
# Check src/test/resources/application-test.yml in all services

# 2. Verify TestContainers configuration
# Update @Testcontainers annotations to use port 5433

# 3. Run integration tests to verify
cd backend/auth-service && mvn test
cd backend/device-service && mvn test

# 4. Update docker-compose.test.yml if it exists
```

**Expected Fix**:
- Update all test application.yml files to use port 5433
- Modify TestContainers configurations in test classes
- Ensure test database isolation works correctly

### Minor Issues and Improvements

#### 4. Service Health Check Optimization
**Resolution**: Implement custom health indicators for better monitoring
**Timeline**: After critical issues resolved

#### 5. Docker Network Security
**Resolution**: Implement proper network isolation between services
**Timeline**: Before production deployment

### 🛠️ Recommended Action Plan

1. **Immediate Priority (Next 1-2 days)**:
   - Fix Redis connectivity and health checks
   - Resolve API Gateway routing configuration
   - Update TestContainers configuration for PostgreSQL port

2. **Short-term (Next week)**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
   - Add service startup dependency management
   - Create health check monitoring dashboard

3. **Before Frontend Integration**:
   - Ensure all backend services are stable and tested
   - Document API endpoints and service interactions
   - Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

user_sessions (id, user_id, token_hash, expires_at)

-- Sites and Devices
sites (id, name, location_lat, location_lng, capacity_mw, status, created_at)

```

### Real-time Data Flow Architecture

```
IoT Devices → MQTT Broker → Kafka → Analytics Service → WebSocket → Frontend
     ↑                        ↓              ↓              ↑
     └── Device Commands ← REST API ← WebSocket ──────────────┘
                              ↓
                         PostgreSQL ← Redis Cache
```

#### Protocol Selection Rationale

**MQTT for IoT Communication:**
- **Device → Backend**: MQTT is the optimal choice for IoT device telemetry
  - Quality of Service (QoS) levels ensure critical data delivery
  - Topic hierarchy: `sites/{siteId}/devices/{deviceId}/{metric}`
  - Retained messages provide last-known device state
  - Lightweight protocol perfect for energy monitoring devices
  - Built-in Last Will Testament for device offline detection

**WebSocket for Frontend Communication:**
- **Backend ↔ Frontend**: WebSockets provide optimal user experience
  - Bidirectional: Real-time data streaming + device control commands
  - Low latency for live dashboard updates
  - Single persistent connection reduces overhead
  - Perfect for interactive device control and acknowledgments

**Alternative Considered: MQTT + Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
- **Pros**: Simpler HTTP-based SSE, better firewall compatibility
- **Cons**: Unidirectional SSE requires separate REST calls for commands
- **Decision**: WebSocket's bidirectional nature better suits interactive energy management

## DevOps and Infrastructure Plan

### Containerization Strategy
- **Frontend**: Nginx-based container for static Next.js build
- **Backend Services**: Individual Docker containers per microservice
- **Databases**: Containerized PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Message Queue**: Kafka + Zookeeper containers
- **MQTT Broker**: Eclipse Mosquitto or HiveMQ container
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger for tracing

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
# Planned workflow stages:
1. Code Quality: ESLint, SonarQube, security scanning
2. Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests
3. Build: Docker image creation for all services
4. Deploy: 
   - Development: Auto-deploy to dev environment
   - Staging: Manual approval for staging deployment
   - Production: Manual approval with blue-green deployment
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
- **Development**: minikube or kind for local development
- **Staging/Production**: Cloud provider (AWS EKS, GCP GKE, or Azure AKS)
- **Helm Charts**: For templated deployments
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for advanced traffic management (future)

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
