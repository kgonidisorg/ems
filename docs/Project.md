users (id, username, email, password_hash, role, created_at, updated_at)
user_sessions (id, user_id, token_hash, expires_at)

-- Sites and Devices
sites (id, name, location_lat, location_lng, capacity_mw, status, created_at)
devices (id, site_id, type, model, status, last_seen, configuration)
device_types (id, name, category, specifications)

-- Energy Data
energy_readings (id, device_id, timestamp, power_kw, energy_kwh, voltage, current)
energy_aggregates (id, site_id, date, total_generation, total_consumption, grid_export)

-- Analytics and Reports
alerts (id, device_id, type, severity, message, acknowledged, created_at)
reports (id, user_id, type, parameters, generated_at, file_path)
```

### Real-time Data Flow Architecture

```
IoT Devices → MQTT Broker → Kafka → Analytics Service → WebSocket → Frontend
     ↑                        ↓              ↓              ↑
     └── Device Commands ← REST API ← WebSocket ──────────────┘
                              ↓
                         PostgreSQL ← Redis Cache
```

#### Protocol Selection Rationale

**MQTT for IoT Communication:**
- **Device → Backend**: MQTT is the optimal choice for IoT device telemetry
  - Quality of Service (QoS) levels ensure critical data delivery
  - Topic hierarchy: `sites/{siteId}/devices/{deviceId}/{metric}`
  - Retained messages provide last-known device state
  - Lightweight protocol perfect for energy monitoring devices
  - Built-in Last Will Testament for device offline detection

**WebSocket for Frontend Communication:**
- **Backend ↔ Frontend**: WebSockets provide optimal user experience
  - Bidirectional: Real-time data streaming + device control commands
  - Low latency for live dashboard updates
  - Single persistent connection reduces overhead
  - Perfect for interactive device control and acknowledgments

**Alternative Considered: MQTT + Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
- **Pros**: Simpler HTTP-based SSE, better firewall compatibility
- **Cons**: Unidirectional SSE requires separate REST calls for commands
- **Decision**: WebSocket's bidirectional nature better suits interactive energy management

## DevOps and Infrastructure Plan

### Containerization Strategy
- **Frontend**: Nginx-based container for static Next.js build
- **Backend Services**: Individual Docker containers per microservice
- **Databases**: Containerized PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Message Queue**: Kafka + Zookeeper containers
- **MQTT Broker**: Eclipse Mosquitto or HiveMQ container
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger for tracing

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
# Planned workflow stages:
1. Code Quality: ESLint, SonarQube, security scanning
2. Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests
3. Build: Docker image creation for all services
4. Deploy: 
   - Development: Auto-deploy to dev environment
   - Staging: Manual approval for staging deployment
   - Production: Manual approval with blue-green deployment
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
- **Development**: minikube or kind for local development
- **Staging/Production**: Cloud provider (AWS EKS, GCP GKE, or Azure AKS)
- **Helm Charts**: For templated deployments
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for advanced traffic management (future)

## 📋 Current Focus Areas

### Immediate Priorities (Next 2-4 weeks)
1. **Frontend Authentication Integration**: Implement JWT-based login system
2. **WebSocket Implementation**: Real-time dashboard data streaming
3. **API Integration**: Replace mock data with backend service calls
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and loading indicators

### Medium-term Goals (Next 1-3 months)
1. **Production Deployment**: Kubernetes manifests and cloud infrastructure
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive analytics and anomaly detection
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
4. **Enterprise Features**: OAuth2 integration and advanced user management

## 🧪 Frontend Authentication Integration Testing Guide

### Quick Start Testing Commands

#### **1. Backend Status Check**
```bash
cd /Users/kiron/Software/ems
docker-compose ps
# Verify all services are running and healthy

# Test API Gateway authentication endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test","password":"test"}'
```

#### **2. Frontend Development Server**
```bash
cd /Users/kiron/Software/ems/frontend
npm run dev
# Frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000
```

### Testing Checklist

#### **✅ Backend Prerequisites** (COMPLETED)
- [x] Docker containers running
- [x] API Gateway responding on :8080
- [x] Auth Service responding on :8081
- [x] Database connections established
- [x] JWT authentication endpoints working

#### **🧪 Authentication Flow Testing** (READY TO TEST)

**Test 1: Login Flow**
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Click login/authentication button
- [ ] Enter test credentials
- [ ] Verify successful login response
- [ ] Check token storage in browser
- [ ] Verify protected routes become accessible

**Test 2: Registration Flow**
- [ ] Open registration form
- [ ] Enter new user details
- [ ] Submit registration
- [ ] Verify user creation response
- [ ] Test immediate login after registration

**Test 3: Protected Routes**
- [ ] Test accessing protected routes without token (should redirect)
- [ ] Login and test protected route access (should work)
- [ ] Test token expiration handling
- [ ] Test manual logout functionality

**Test 4: Error Handling**
- [ ] Test invalid login credentials
- [ ] Test network errors
- [ ] Test malformed API responses
- [ ] Test user-friendly error messages

**Test 5: User Experience**
- [ ] Test loading states during API calls
- [ ] Test form validation messages
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile
- [ ] Test browser back/forward button behavior

#### **🔧 Debug Tools**

**Browser Developer Tools:**
```javascript
// Check authentication state in console
localStorage.getItem('auth_token')
localStorage.getItem('auth_user')

// Check network requests in Network tab
// Look for API calls to localhost:8080/api/auth/*
```

**Backend Logs:**
```bash
# Monitor API Gateway logs
docker logs -f ems-api-gateway

# Monitor Auth Service logs
docker logs -f ems-auth-service
```

### Expected Test Results

#### **Successful Login Flow:**
1. Frontend sends POST to `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login`
2. API Gateway routes to Auth Service
3. Auth Service validates credentials
4. Returns JWT token and user data
5. Frontend stores token and updates UI
6. Protected routes become accessible

#### **Error Scenarios:**
- Invalid credentials → 401 response with error message
- Network issues → User-friendly error display
- Token expiration → Automatic redirect to login

### 🎯 Integration Success Metrics

**Authentication Integration Complete When:**
- [ ] Users can successfully log in via frontend
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly managed and stored
- [ ] Protected routes work correctly
- [ ] Error handling provides good user experience
- [ ] Token persistence works across browser sessions
- [ ] All authentication components are visually polished
